## **Description**
NiceBots! is an android mobile robot fighting game that allows users to build their fighers depending on their personality scores.

The game uses IBM's Watson Personality Insights AI to build a profile from people's Twitter account. This is then compared to their ideal personality (which they choose at the start of the game). This then unlocks various weapons, shields and other powerups to build a tiny space fighter. User's play against each other in realtime to level up and improve their little bot, all with a focus on what makes a good person.
